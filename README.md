#Text Recognition

##How it works?

The Text Recognition project employs a straightforward approach to identify text within an uploaded image. The process involves scanning each pixel of the image, where the program assesses if a pixel is darker. The darker pixels are indicative of text presence. Subsequently, the application compiles each row of pixels into an array, forming the basis for further text recognition and analysis.

This method allows the program to create a structured representation of the image content, paving the way for potential text extraction and analysis in subsequent stages of the project.
